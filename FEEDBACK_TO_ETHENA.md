Dear Ethena Team,

I'm deeply passionate about joining Ethena Labs and contributing to your innovative ecosystem. Through building EthenaFun, I've gained hands-on experience with your technology stack and am thoroughly impressed with its potential. I would be thrilled to bring my expertise in blockchain development and my creative approach to gaming applications to your team.

My project demonstrates not just technical proficiency, but also a vision for expanding USDe's use cases into engaging, consumer-facing applications. I'm particularly excited about the possibility of developing more applications that could help drive mainstream adoption of the Ethena ecosystem.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I could contribute to Ethena's mission. You can reach me at:

Best regards,
Arpit
