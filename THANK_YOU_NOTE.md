Dear Rebecca and the Encode Club Team,

I wanted to express my heartfelt gratitude for your consistent support throughout the Ethena Hackathon. Your regular updates and reminders were instrumental in keeping me focused and motivated. Thanks to your diligent communication, I was able to complete my project "EthenaFun" and submit it on time.

The hackathon has been an incredible learning experience, allowing me to dive deep into Ethena's technology stack and create something meaningful. I'm particularly grateful for:
- Your clear communication about deadlines and requirements
- The comprehensive Hacker Pack documentation
- Regular email updates that kept me on track
- The opportunity to build with cutting-edge blockchain technology

Special thanks to the Ethena team for providing such robust technology to build upon. This experience has only strengthened my desire to contribute to the Ethena ecosystem, and I hope to have the opportunity to join the team in the future.
