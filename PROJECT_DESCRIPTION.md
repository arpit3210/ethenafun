I built EthenaFun, an engaging Head or Tail betting game that showcases USDe's potential in casual gaming. Players can bet USDe tokens (0.1 to 0.5) on coin flip outcomes, with a 1.7x multiplier for normal wins and an exciting 2.2x bonus multiplier (4% chance). The game features provably fair mechanics through VRF integration and transparent statistics tracked via Goldsky subgraphs.

The project includes:
- Smart contracts deployed on Ethena testnet
- Next.js frontend with modern UI/UX
- Real-time game statistics and leaderboards
- Automated token management
- Cross-chain ready architecture using LayerZero

This implementation demonstrates how blockchain gaming can be both entertaining and fair while utilizing Ethena's infrastructure. The project goes beyond traditional DeFi applications by creating an accessible, social gaming experience that could attract mainstream users to the Ethena ecosystem.
